      <h1>My Thoughts on the Web</h1>

    <div class="main">
      <p>What is <q>The Web</q>? When I first started using the the web it was only available in <q>The Computer Lounge</q> on the bottom floor of my dorm. It was dark and smelly (even smellier than the rest of the men's dorm) and <strong>SLOW</strong>. Just sending a couple emails and checking a couple web pages could take hours and you had to wait in queue for a computer to be available! It was not a very appealing or user-friendly process.</p>

      <p>The web has come long way from my dorm room dungeon days. Today my young kids have access to every video game from MY childhood, they can watch movies, TV, and even do basic Google searches on their choice of
        <ul>
          <li>Kindle Fire</li>
          <li>smart phones</li>
          <li>desktop computer</li>
          <li>Windows or Mac laptops</li>
        </ul>
        in our house. The line between what the web is and how it is actually used or experienced is changing so fast that the line between web browser and application will be indistinguishable. I'd like to be at the front of that wave and be creating content for the next iteration of the web</p>
